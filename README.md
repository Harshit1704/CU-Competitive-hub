# CU-Event Management System

CU-Event Management System is a web page initially for students of Chandigarh University for getting them notified about all comptetions and events held in college and outside college which are technical and non technical. Most of you may be familar with site like sarkariresult.com which i think most of us had used, basically it is similar to it.

Main aim of this project to link it with college official informaton management site, and then on that page teachers,organisations and admins can post events and competition 
on that page by which it become easier for student to get notified and the for admins it become easier to manage records.
